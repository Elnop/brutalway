# @brutalway/oxlint-config-tanstack-query

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b57e92: New `server-state` option on vite, off by default: the example reads and writes its todos through TanStack Query against the routes of template-fastify. `todosClient.ts` parses each response with Zod, query keys come from `todosKeys`, cache windows from `src/shared/QueryConfig.ts`, and the zustand store only keeps the filter. `devApi.ts` answers `/api` from an in-memory list in dev and preview, or proxies it to `API_URL`.
  
  `@brutalway/oxlint-config-tanstack-query` is a new package: `query-key-factory` and `named-cache-windows`, plus `exhaustive-deps` and `stable-query-client` from `@tanstack/eslint-plugin-query`. `@brutalway/oxlint-config-react` only accepts `fetch` in an `xClient.ts` and never inside an effect. The `xSchemas.ts` convention moves from the Fastify config to the TypeScript base, so the front gets it too. dependency-cruiser keeps clients, query hooks and `@tanstack/react-query` out of presenters and stores, and check-tree learns `xKeys.ts` and the `keys/` folder.
