`src/app/` imports features only, and a file of a `shared/` folder that a single feature uses moves into it. On fastify, the server and its Swagger UI live in `src/features/http-server/`, the connection in `src/features/database/`, a service builds its queries from the database it gets, the route tests mount their feature on `test-utils/createTestServer.ts`, `ErrorSchema` moves into `src/features/todo-list/TodoListSchemas.ts` and `readEnv.ts` to the root of `src/shared/`. On react-native, the frame of the page and the themed stack come from `src/features/page-shell/`. On package, `todosFile.ts` reads and writes the JSON itself, since it was the only user of `src/shared/jsonFile.ts`.
