`npm run check` runs knip a second time with `--production`, on `src/` without its tests, so a file or an export of `src/` that only a test uses is reported. A helper shared by tests goes in `test-utils/`, at the root, imported through `@test-utils/` (`#test-utils/` on fastify and package), and `@brutalway/dependency-cruiser-config` 0.8.0 rejects an import of it from production code. On vite, next and react-native, dependency-cruiser reads `tsconfig.test.json` to resolve that alias. On next, `check-tree` runs with `--root-entries`, so `src/proxy.ts` and the other files Next.js reads at the root of `src/` stay there. template-next moves to `@brutalway/oxlint-config-next` 0.1.2, which accepts `src/instrumentation-client.ts`.
